    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Nasi Padang</em> (Padang Rice in English) is a steamed rice dish from the city of Padang in West Sumatra. It is an Indonesian staple that is served and enjoyed in innumerable <em>warungs</em> (small family restaurants) across the country. What an individual serving looks like varies from warung to warung, and even from customer to customer, as each chef prepares a type of buffet from which customers can choose side dishes to accompany their rice.
